Forwards requsts to 15.ai or google (for gtts voice), since we can't modify headers ingame

To install
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run
```
python3 app.py
```
to start the server

For example:

```
http://localhost:5000/15ai?character=GLaDOS&text=wow%20hi%20there
http://localhost:5000/gtts?text=wow%20hi%20there
```

It outputs as `Success\nfilePath.wav\ninput text` or `Error\n\ninput text`
